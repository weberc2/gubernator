## Progress

* Created a GlobGroup because it's going to be necessary to put multiple files
  into a single directory in the cache (and it doesn't suffice to grab a whole
  directory because we'll often want to ignore various files in the tree).

* Added support for "packages" in a package directory ".vendor" to support some
  notion of reusability at the Starlark level. In the future this will evolve
  into something like Go modules (where the tool can resolve and fetch
  dependencies over the network); however, for now, the intention is to have
  users manage their own .vendor directories.

* I've been informally testing this by creating toy packages in the .vendor
  directory (.vendor/go and .vendor/helpers)

## TODO

* Create dedicated repository
* Migrate this TODO list to issues and milestones
* Set up CI with unit tests and self-hosted build
* End-to-end tests (create various test case directory structures and assert
  that the build cache contains the right things?)
* Make sure builders run with read-only access to cache
